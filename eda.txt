# Types of plots

## Continuous vs. Discrete

- Bar plots: Need to come up with an aggregate value for the continous variable and doesn't show spread
- Box and whisker plots: Good because it shows distribution of response for each discrete value. However, can get cluttered for large number of groups
- Overlapping histograms: Shows distribution of response. However, not very feasible for > 2 groups, and they should ideally be around the same size
- Overlapping density plots: Less cluttered than overlapping histograms. However, more to tune for visualization.
