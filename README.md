# refresher
One stop shop for the information needed to get up to speed on a variety of tools

This repository is a personal project that serves to consolidate information I've worked with across various any subject of interest (both technologies and theory).

It is meant to be updated as needed - if I ever encounter trouble/confusion on an issue, I'll try to describe the solution as well as a reproducible example on what's going on.
